# CrowdStrike Core FLTR Package

This package contains a robust set of content for use with Falcon Long Term Repository (FLTR). 

## Important

This package should be installed in a *view* linked to your FLTR repo. It is not necessary or recommended to install this directly into the FLTR repo. The FLTR *repo* should already have the additional `crowdstrike/fdr` package installed, which contains the parser necessary for this data.

If both packages are mistakenly installed in the FLTR repo, go to `Alerts -> Scheduled Searches -> FDR aidmaster Scheduled Search` and **uncheck** `Enable scheduled search` followed by `Save Scheduled Search`. Otherwise both packages will be attempting to generate the same file. You only need the `FLTR aidmaster Generation` scheduled search running. 

## Setup Instructions

Follow the [package setup instructions](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-community-content/wiki/FLTR-Setup-and-Configuration) to get going. It is highly recommended that you follow these steps after installing this package.

## Package Contents

### Dashboards

There is a selection of dashboards for getting quick value with FLTR. These may serve as the basis for building custom FLTR dashboards, alerts, and queries to match your specific use case.

### Queries

This package provides a wide range of saved queries. These can all be customized or used as a reference point for building additional queries. There is also a selection of user functions to assist with commonly used queries. 

### Event Interactions

Event interactions are included for both `aid` and `UserName` fields. This allows you to quickly pivot between the search and dashboard sections. 

### Schedules Searches

A scheduled search is included that generates the `fdr_aidmaster.csv` lookup file for matching the `aid` to `ComputerName` values.
