## Dependencies
To facilitate this organizations will need a cloud managed Chrome browser or Chrome device and to connect the data feed to LogScale's HEC endpoint API as described here: [Configuring Google Chrome Enterprise Connector](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/11375053)

## Installation
This is a quick introduction to getting started with the package. For detailed instructions on setting things up, please see the [LogScale Library](https://library.humio.com/humio-server/integrations-google-chrome-enterprise.html).

1. Install this package in the relevant repository and create a new ingest token for the Google_Chrome_Enterprise parser and copy this token value. Assign the parser from this package to the token.
2. Configure Google Chrome Enterprise Connector Framework to send logs to LogScale
3. (Optional) Add blocklisted/unwanted Chome Browser Extensions to the lookup file "chrome_extensions_blocklist.csv" with the column name "extension_id" for the "Blocklisted Extension Installed" widget in the "Chrome Enterprise Security Extension Dashboard". Values for the "extension_id" column are the unique ID of the extension from the Chrome web store. The ID can be found in the URL of the extension in the Chrome web store. Eg: "kchfmpdcejfkipopnolndinkeoipnoia" for "User-Agent Switcher"

You should now see the LogScale dashboards begin to populate and can start searching the data.
