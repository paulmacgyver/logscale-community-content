ExitCode,6719,ExitCode_6719,The object specified could not be created or opened because its associated TransactionManager is not online. The TransactionManager must be brought fully Online by calling RecoverTransactionManager to recover to the end of its LogFile before objects in its Transaction or ResourceManager namespaces can be opened. In addition errors in writing records to its LogFile can cause a TransactionManager to go offline.
ExitCode,672,ExitCode_672,A translator failed to translate resources.
ExitCode,6720,ExitCode_6720,The specified TransactionManager was unable to create the objects contained in its logfile in the Ob namespace. Therefore the TransactionManager was unable to recover.

ExitCode,6729,ExitCode_6729,The transaction cannot be enlisted on with the specified EnlistmentMask because the transaction has already completed the PrePrepare phase.

ExitCode,6826,ExitCode_6826,The $Txf directory must be empty for this operation to succeed.
ExitCode,6827,ExitCode_6827,The operation would leave a transactional resource manager in an inconsistent state and is therefore not allowed.
ExitCode,6828,ExitCode_6828,The operation could not be completed because the transaction manager does not have a log.
